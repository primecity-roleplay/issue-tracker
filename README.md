This repo is purely to maintain issues & suggestions for Prime City Servers

Issues
It is requested that you report any issues you may encounter in the "Issues" tab in this GitHub repository.

Rules
To make sure we're all on the same page about what this issue tracker is meant for, please read through and follow the rules below.

§ 1. All issues should be in English, and only English.
§ 2. Give your issue a proper title.
§ 3. When creating an issue, select and follow a template.
§ 4. Your issues should include as much relevant information as you can provide.
§ 5. Suggestions should be specific and structured, and not vague and undetermined.
§ 6. The framework is meant to be easily scalable and future proof, meaning creating issues to request a 'turf' and 'storage container' for your gang should not be done. Be more creative and propose something that is scalable and dynamic.
§ 7. Engaging in the comment section of issues is encouraged, though please do not post comments without any value, i.e. "+1" comments. Use GitHub's reaction feature for such instead.
§ 9. Issues should be associated with server.
§ 10. Only include one topic per issue..
